# Project Title: Customer Segmentation Analysis (DataMites Course Project)

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of my Data Analyst course at **DataMites**.it focuses on performing **Customer
Segmentation** using real-world data. The project demonstrates practical
application of data analytics concepts such as data preprocessing, EDA,
clustering techniques, and insights generation.

## ❓ What is the Project?

This project involves analyzing customer data and grouping customers
into distinct segments based on their behavior, demographics, and
purchase patterns. By using clustering algorithms and statistical
techniques, the goal is to understand customer groups and help
businesses make data-driven decisions.
